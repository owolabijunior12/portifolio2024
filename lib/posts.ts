    title: "Creating a Secure NFC Tap-to-Pay System",
    excerpt: "A deep dive into building a secure NFC payment system powered by ESP32, AES encryption, and tokenization.",
    content: `
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This project aimed to replicate the security and functionality of Apple Pay/Google Pay for the African market.</p>

      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>React Native (Frontend)</li>
        <li>Node.js + Express (Backend)</li>
        <li>ESP32 + PN532 NFC module</li>
        <li>AES-256 Encryption</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tap-to-pay authentication using secure NFC</li>
        <li>AES-256 token encryption with manually set keys</li>
        <li>Secure storage of passcode on NFC card</li>
        <li>API sends token to backend after tap</li>
        <li>Tamper protection and hidden passcodes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
      <h3>üîê Secure Token Generation</h3>
      <p>The token included user ID, timestamp, and transaction metadata, encrypted using AES-256. I added a replay-attack check on the backend to ensure each token could be used only once.</p>

      <h3>üì∂ Hardware Integration</h3>
      <p>The PN532 often failed during multiple writes. I had to switch from I2C to SPI for more stable communication and added retry buffers with acknowledgment checks.</p>

      <h3>üóùÔ∏è Key Management</h3>
      <p>To prevent firmware hacks, I encrypted the key in flash memory using a salt hardcoded in the ESP32 and wrote a custom decoder that only runs after NFC pairing.</p>

      <h3>üö´ Tamper Detection</h3>
      <p>A three-strike logic was implemented. After 3 wrong attempts, the NFC card is soft-locked and can only be reset by admin intervention. I also log brute force attempts to an audit trail.</p>
